## Description
Food trucks are some of the best ways to try new and good food, and to support small
businesses. However, finding local food trucks can be difficult wherever you are. Also to
mention, food truck locations and schedules are always subject to change . So to help
customers find a new food truck or where their favorite food truck is going to be next, would be
very helpful and easy. It would also take out the guesswork on where and when the food truck
will pop up.

Therefore, we decided to create an iOS application that locates local food truck vendor based
on your location. Vendors can creare an account and schedule their day to day or week locations to
help people know where and when they will be. Possible implementation of a follower system
from users to vendors to get updates on where your favorite food trucks will be.
